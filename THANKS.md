Thanks to influencers
---------------------

* Douglas Engelbart et al. for the "Mother of All Demos" in 1968, for
  showing a truly remarkable way to demonstrate the features and
  functions of an advanced computer system.

* Ken Thompson et al. for developing and publishing Unix in 1973, the
  operating system that has become the foothold of the world.

* Don Lancaster, for showing the world in 1973 that a computer
  terminal can be built by hand as a hobby project, the TV Typewriter.

* The Intel 8080 CPU development team at Intel commercializing the
  Intel 8080 CPU in 1974, a popular example of the design of a 16-bit
  CPU.

* Ed Roberts, Forrest M. Mims III, et al. of MITS for
  publishing/commercializing the Altair 8800 computer in 1975, an
  undisputable influencer and valuable software development tool for
  later home computers like the Apple II to come.

* Paul Allen and Bill Gates for publishing MICROSOFT BASIC in the
  1975, an popular example of a pre-boot high-level programming
  language.

* Chuck Peddle et al. of MOS Technology for commercializing the 6502
  CPU in 1975, a major component of many 1970s/1980s 8-bit home
  computers and a major influencer in the design of simple 8-bit CPUs.

* Joseph Weisbecker for publishing the COSMAC ELF in Popular
  Electronics in 1976, a great example of a small computer with a more
  user-friendly front panel control switch.

* Dennis Allison for publishing Tiny BASIC in the 1976, the popular
  counterpart to the proprietary MICROSOFT BASIC that coined the term
  copyleft in the vein of free, libre, and open-source software.

* Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, et al. of Apple Computer for
  commercializing the Apple II in 1977, the 8-bit home computer that
  has had the most design influence on Quorten's BPC.

* Roger Gourd, Dave Cutler, Dick Hustvedt, Peter Lipman, et al. of
  Starlet development team of Digital Equipment Corporation for
  commercializing the VAX-11/VMS operating system in 1977 with a
  versioning file system.

* Brian Kerningham, Dennis Ritchie, et al. for publishing the C
  programming language in 1978, the mother of all modern programming
  languages.

* Tim Patterson et al. of Seattle Computer Products for
  commercializing QDOS and QDOS DEBUG in 1980, the progenitors of
  MS-DOS and MS-DOS DEBUG.

* Jack Tramiel et al. of Commodore International for commercializing
  the VIC-20 in 1980, the precursor of the Commodore 64 and notable
  for implementing serial communications via bit banging rather than
  including an serial communications chip.

* Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Susan Kare, Steve Jobs, et al. of
  Apple Computer for developing/commercializing the Macintosh computer
  in 1984, a major influence on modern graphical user interfaces and
  small computer GUI APIs.

* Richard Stallman et al. of the GNU Project for announcing,
  organizing, and starting development on the GNU Project in 1984,
  when it was not yet clear that anything significant beyond GNU Emacs
  would come out of it.  For those who desire the will to succeed for
  doing something great in its own right.

* IBM PS/2 development team of IBM for developing/commercializing the
  IBM PS/2 in 1987, the IBM PC that was small, simple, and showcased a
  relatively wide range of useful hardware peripherals.

* Microsoft Winodws development team of Microsoft for commercializing
  Windows (3.1) API in 1992, a good design evolution of a GUI API that
  was strongly influenced by the Macintosh computer.

* David Schmitt et al. of the Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS community for
  Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS in 2006, whose software and documentation
  was extremely instrumental in setting up vintage Apple II computers
  in the modern era.

* Randall Byrant and David O'Hallaron for publishing _Computer
  Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 2nd edition_ in 2011, for my
  comment of the issue of designing a CPU solely for college classes.
  Without exposure to their book, I would not have recognized the
  elephant in the room.

* David Patterson and Jonhn Hennessy for publishing the book _Computer
  Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, 5th edition_ in 2012, which
  influenced the CPU hardware design considerations.

* Lee Hart for publishing a COSMAC ELF clone in 2012.

* Eben Upton et al. of Raspberry Pi Foundation in 2013 for
  commercializing the ARM-based Raspberry Pi single-board computer.

* Stephen Cass for publishing an article on Lee Hart's COSMAC ELF
  clone in IEEE Spectrum in 2015 for moderners.

* And countless others who have influenced these influencers but have
  not been mentioned here for the sake of brevity!
